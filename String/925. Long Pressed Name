Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character 
will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters 
(possibly none) being long pressed.
